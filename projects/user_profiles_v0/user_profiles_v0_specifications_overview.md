# User Profiles V0 Specifications Overview

## Overview
The User Profiles V0 is an AI-driven user management system for thinkheads.ai, enabling personalized profiles with AI/ML learning progress tracking and portfolio integration. This document summarizes specifications for implementing requirements from **4.5.1 User_Profiles_Requirements.md**, assigning identifiers to detailed specifications in the `/docs/projects/user_profiles_specifications/` subfolder. It supports solo development within a 20-hour/week schedule, using Proxmox for compute-intensive tasks (Ollama, PostgreSQL) and Linode for lightweight APIs (FastAPI), with a tech stack including Cloudflare, n8n, and RustDesk. The MVP is targeted for August 2026, per **3.2 Project_Roadmap.md**.

## System Architecture
- **Description**: Integrates with the AI-driven website, using a hybrid architecture with LLM and database on Proxmox and APIs on Linode.
- **Components and Specification Identifiers**:
  - **Backend (SPEC-UP-BACK)**: API endpoints for profile management and personalization, powered by Ollama.
  - **Database (SPEC-UP-DB)**: Storage for user profiles, progress data, and RAG embeddings.
  - **Frontend (SPEC-UP-FRONT)**: Web interface for profile management and portfolio display, integrated with thinkheads.ai.
  - **Automation and Monitoring (SPEC-UP-AUTO)**: Automated deployment and monitoring for maintainability.

## Specification Summaries

|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| SPEC-UP-BACK   | Backend             | Provide API endpoints for user profile management and LLM-driven personalization, with authentication. | High     | FR01, FR02, NFR04   |
| SPEC-UP-DB     | Database            | Store user profiles, progress data, and RAG embeddings for context-aware personalization. | High     | FR02, FR03          |
| SPEC-UP-FRONT  | Frontend            | Web interface for profile creation, progress tracking, and portfolio display, integrated with thinkheads.ai. | High     | FR01, FR02, FR03, NFR04 |
| SPEC-UP-AUTO   | Automation & Monitoring | Automate content updates, profile exports, and system monitoring. | Medium   | NFR05               |

## RAG Integration
- **Usage**: Feeds into Meeting Roomâ€™s RAG pipeline for planning and personalization.
- **Structure**: Consistent headers, tables, and metadata for parseability. Specification IDs link to detailed documents.
- **Storage**: Store in `/docs/projects/`, sync to Linode for thinkheads.ai, embed in PostgreSQL for RAG queries.

## Success Metrics
- **Implementation**: Deploy MVP (SPEC-UP-BACK, SPEC-UP-DB, SPEC-UP-FRONT) by August 2026.
- **Learning**: Master user authentication, database management, and personalization by September 2026.
- **Portfolio**: Achieve 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn by September 2026.
- **Performance**: <2s LLM response time, 99% uptime.
- **Engagement**: Contribute to 100+ unique visitors to thinkheads.ai by September 2026.
