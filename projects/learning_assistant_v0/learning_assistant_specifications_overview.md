# Learning Assistant V0 Specifications Overview

## Overview
The Learning Assistant V0 is an AI-powered tool for thinkheads.ai, supporting AI/ML/DL learning through personalized resource suggestions, note-taking, and interactive exercises. This document summarizes specifications for implementing requirements from **4.2.1 Learning_Assistant_Requirements.md**, assigning identifiers to detailed specifications in the `/docs/projects/learning_assistant_specifications/` subfolder. It supports solo development within a 20-hour/week schedule, using Proxmox for compute-intensive tasks (Ollama, PostgreSQL) and Linode for lightweight APIs (FastAPI), with a tech stack including Cloudflare, n8n, and RustDesk. The MVP is targeted for December 2025, per **3.2 Project_Roadmap.md**.

## System Architecture
- **Description**: Integrates with the AI-driven website, using a hybrid architecture with LLM and database on Proxmox and APIs on Linode.
- **Components and Specification Identifiers**:
  - **Backend (SPEC-LA-BACK)**: API endpoints for resource suggestions and exercise generation, powered by Ollama.
  - **Database (SPEC-LA-DB)**: Storage for notes, session data, and RAG embeddings.
  - **Frontend (SPEC-LA-FRONT)**: Web interface for user interactions, integrated with AI-driven website.
  - **Automation and Monitoring (SPEC-LA-AUTO)**: Automated deployment and monitoring for maintainability.

## Specification Summaries
| ID             | Component           | Summary                                              | Priority | Related Requirements |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| SPEC-LA-BACK   | Backend             | Provide API endpoints for LLM-driven resource suggestions and exercise generation, with session management. | High     | FR01, FR03, NFR04   |
| SPEC-LA-DB     | Database            | Store notes, session data, and RAG embeddings for context-aware LLM responses. | High     | FR02, FR04          |
| SPEC-LA-FRONT  | Frontend            | Web interface for querying resources, saving notes, and accessing exercises, integrated with thinkheads.ai. | High     | FR01, FR02, FR03, NFR04 |
| SPEC-LA-AUTO   | Automation & Monitoring | Automate content updates, note exports, and system monitoring. | Medium   | NFR05               |

## RAG Integration
- **Usage**: Feeds into Meeting Roomâ€™s RAG pipeline for development planning and resource curation.
- **Structure**: Consistent headers, tables, and metadata for parseability. Specification IDs link to detailed documents.
- **Storage**: Store in `/docs/projects/`, sync to Linode for thinkheads.ai, embed in PostgreSQL for RAG queries.

## Success Metrics
- **Implementation**: Deploy MVP (SPEC-LA-BACK, SPEC-LA-DB, SPEC-LA-FRONT) by December 2025.
- **Learning**: Master RAG, LLM fine-tuning, and PostgreSQL by February 2026.
- **Portfolio**: Achieve 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn by February 2026.
- **Performance**: <2s LLM response time, 99% uptime.
- **Engagement**: Contribute to 100+ unique visitors to thinkheads.ai by February 2026.
