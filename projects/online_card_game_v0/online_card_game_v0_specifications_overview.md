# Online Card Game V0 Specifications Overview

## Overview
The Online Card Game V0 is an AI-driven multiplayer card game for thinkheads.ai, incorporating educational AI/ML challenges. This document summarizes specifications for implementing requirements from **4.4.1 Online_Card_Game_Requirements.md**, assigning identifiers to detailed specifications in the `/docs/projects/online_card_game_specifications/` subfolder. It supports solo development within a 20-hour/week schedule, using Proxmox for compute-intensive tasks (Ollama, PostgreSQL) and Linode for lightweight APIs (FastAPI) and game server, with a tech stack including Cloudflare, n8n, and RustDesk. The MVP is targeted for June 2026, per **3.2 Project_Roadmap.md**.

## System Architecture
- **Description**: Integrates with the AI-driven website, using a hybrid architecture with LLM and database on Proxmox and APIs/game server on Linode.
- **Components and Specification Identifiers**:
  - **Backend (SPEC-CG-BACK)**: API endpoints for game logic and AI-driven challenges, powered by Ollama.
  - **Database (SPEC-CG-DB)**: Storage for game states, session data, and RAG embeddings.
  - **Frontend (SPEC-CG-FRONT)**: Web interface for gameplay and challenges, integrated with thinkheads.ai.
  - **Automation and Monitoring (SPEC-CG-AUTO)**: Automated deployment and monitoring for maintainability.

## Specification Summaries
| ID             | Component           | Summary                                              | Priority | Related Requirements |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| SPEC-CG-BACK   | Backend             | Provide API endpoints for multiplayer game logic and AI-driven challenges, with session management. | High     | FR01, FR02, NFR04   |
| SPEC-CG-DB     | Database            | Store game states, session data, and RAG embeddings for context-aware LLM responses. | High     | FR03, FR04          |
| SPEC-CG-FRONT  | Frontend            | Web interface for multiplayer gameplay and AI-driven challenges, integrated with thinkheads.ai. | High     | FR01, FR02, FR03, NFR04 |
| SPEC-CG-AUTO   | Automation & Monitoring | Automate content updates, game state exports, and system monitoring. | Medium   | NFR05               |

## RAG Integration
- **Usage**: Feeds into Meeting Roomâ€™s RAG pipeline for development planning and challenge content generation.
- **Structure**: Consistent headers, tables, and metadata for parseability. Specification IDs link to detailed documents.
- **Storage**: Store in `/docs/projects/`, sync to Linode for thinkheads.ai, embed in PostgreSQL for RAG queries.

## Success Metrics
- **Implementation**: Deploy MVP (SPEC-CG-BACK, SPEC-CG-DB, SPEC-CG-FRONT) by June 2026.
- **Learning**: Master game development, real-time APIs, and LLM integration by July 2026.
- **Portfolio**: Achieve 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn by July 2026.
- **Performance**: <1s API response time, 99% uptime.
- **Engagement**: Contribute to 100+ unique visitors to thinkheads.ai by July 2026.
