# Online Card Game V0 Requirements

## Overview
The Online Card Game V0 is an AI-driven multiplayer card game for thinkheads.ai, incorporating educational AI/ML challenges to engage users and reinforce learning. Integrated with the AI-driven website, it uses Ollama for AI-driven card effects and PostgreSQL for game state storage. This document outlines functional and non-functional requirements to support skill development and portfolio enhancement, designed for solo development within a 20-hour/week schedule, using Proxmox (Ollama, PostgreSQL) and Linode (APIs), per **3.2 Project_Roadmap.md**.

## Functional Requirements
| ID  | Requirement Description                              | Priority | Acceptance Criteria                                      |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| FR01 | **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Support real-time multiplayer card gameplay for 2-4 players. | High     | - Users join games via web interface.<br>- Supports 2-4 players with real-time updates.<br>- Game state updates in <1s for 95% of actions.<br>- Includes basic card mechanics (e.g., draw, play, discard). |
| FR02 | **AI-Driven Challenges**: Provide educational AI/ML-themed card effects generated by LLM. | High     | - LLM (Ollama) generates challenge prompts (e.g., “Solve a neural network query”).<br>- Challenges delivered in <2s.<br>- Supports 10+ challenge types. |
| FR03 | **Game State Persistence**: Store game states and player progress. | Medium   | - Game states stored in PostgreSQL, linked to sessions.<br>- Supports 100+ games per user.<br>- Accessible via web interface.<br>- Saves/restores in <5s. |

## Non-Functional Requirements
| ID  | Requirement Description                              | Priority | Acceptance Criteria                                      |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR01 | **High Availability**: Ensure game uptime and reliability. | High     | - 99% uptime via Cloudflare and Nginx.<br>- Downtime <10 minutes/month for maintenance. |
| NFR02 | **Security**: Protect user data and game interactions. | High     | - HTTPS via Cloudflare SSL/TLS.<br>- Encrypted PostgreSQL connections.<br>- No OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. |
| NFR03 | **Scalability**: Handle expected usage.              | Medium   | - Supports 10 concurrent players on Linode (4 GB RAM).<br>- API handles 20+ requests/second.<br>- Cloudflare caching for static content. |
| NFR04 | **Performance**: Ensure fast response times.         | High     | - API responses <1s for 95% of game actions.<br>- LLM challenges <2s.<br>- Responsive web interface for mobile/desktop. |
| NFR05 | **Maintainability**: Enable easy updates and monitoring. | Medium   | - Markdown updates via Git, auto-deployed by n8n.<br>- Monitoring via n8n and RustDesk.<br>- Documentation for all components. |

## Technical Constraints
- **Hardware**:
  - Proxmox: Hosts Ollama (`dockProd1`, 1 RTX 5060 Ti GPU) and PostgreSQL (`dockProd2`, 16 GB RAM).
  - Linode: Hosts FastAPI endpoints and game server, limited by 4 GB RAM; offload LLM tasks to Proxmox.
- **Software**: Ollama, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, n8n, Cloudflare, integrated with AI-driven website (Hugo, Nginx).
- **Time**: ~200 hours for MVP (FR01-FR02, NFR01-NFR04) by June 2026, per **3.2 Project_Roadmap.md**.
- **Solo Operation**: Use n8n for automation, RustDesk for remote management.

## User Flows
- **Player (Self)**:
  1. Access Online Card Game via thinkheads.ai.
  2. Join multiplayer game (FR01), engage with AI-driven challenges (FR02), save progress (FR03).
  3. Export game logs as markdown for portfolio use.
- **Employer/Community**:
  1. View game demo on thinkheads.ai.
  2. Explore sample gameplay and challenges to assess technical skills.
- **RAG Integration**: Markdown documents and game logs feed into Ollama for challenge generation.

## RAG Integration
- **Usage**: Feeds into Meeting Room’s RAG pipeline for planning and challenge content generation.
- **Structure**: Consistent headers, tables, and metadata for parseability.
- **Storage**: Store in `/docs/projects/`, sync to Linode, embed in PostgreSQL for RAG queries.

## Success Metrics
- **Feature Completion**: Deploy MVP (FR01-FR02, NFR01-NFR04) by June 2026.
- **Learning**: Master game development, real-time APIs, and LLM integration by July 2026.
- **Portfolio**: Achieve 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn by July 2026.
- **Performance**: <1s API response time, 99% uptime.
- **Engagement**: Contribute to 100+ unique visitors to thinkheads.ai by July 2026.
