# ThinkHeads.ai Feature Backlog

## Overview
The feature backlog lists all planned features for thinkheads.ai sub-products, prioritized to maximize AI/ML/DL learning, portfolio impact, and community engagement. Features are designed to demonstrate technical expertise (e.g., LLM integration, RAG, full-stack development) while aligning with the goal of securing a job in the AI industry within 12 months. The backlog is structured for human readability and RAG ingestion, enabling strategic planning via the Meeting Room sub-product.

## Feature List
The table below details each feature, including its sub-product, description, priority, estimated effort, and status. Prioritization is based on learning value, portfolio impact, and feasibility within resource constraints (Proxmox server, Linode server, 20 hours/week).

## Prioritization Criteria
Features are prioritized based on the following criteria, scored on a 1-5 scale (5 = highest):
- **Learning Value**: Contribution to AI/ML/DL skills (e.g., LLM fine-tuning, RAG, image processing).
- **Portfolio Impact**: Appeal to potential employers, showcasing technical and creative skills.
- **Feasibility**: Alignment with resource constraints (Proxmox GPU capacity, Linode 4 GB RAM, 20 hours/week).
- **Community Engagement**: Potential to attract users (e.g., friends for card game, tech community for portfolio).

### Example Scoring
- **F01: Chat-based navigation**:
  - Learning Value: 5 (LLM integration, RAG).
  - Portfolio Impact: 5 (Showcases AI-driven UI).
  - Feasibility: 4 (Moderate effort, leverages Ollama).
  - Engagement: 3 (Functional but not primary user draw).
  - **Total**: High priority.
- **F10: Multiplayer gameplay**:
  - Learning Value: 3 (WebSocket, less AI focus).
  - Portfolio Impact: 3 (Fun but less job-relevant).
  - Feasibility: 3 (Higher effort, Linode constraints).
  - Engagement: 5 (Attracts friends).
  - **Total**: Low priority.

## Implementation Notes
- **Tech Stack Alignment**:
  - **Proxmox**: Hosts compute-intensive features (F01, F04, F07, F12, F14) using LXC containers (`dockProd1`, `dockProd2`) with GPU passthrough (RTX 5060 Ti).
  - **Linode**: Hosts lightweight features (F02, F03, F10, F11, F13, F15) via Hugo, Nginx, and FastAPI in Docker.
  - **Automation**: n8n schedules overnight tasks (F14) and syncs data (F05, F08, F11, F13) to PostgreSQL.
  - **Security**: Cloudflare Tunnel and RustDesk secure remote access (F03, F09, F13).
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - GPU tasks (F01, F04, F07, F12, F14) are scheduled to avoid conflicts (e.g., dynamic GPU release between `dockProd1` and `dockProd2`).
  - Linodeâ€™s 4 GB RAM limits complex backend services; prioritize static content (F02) and offload AI tasks to Proxmox.
- **RAG Integration**: Features with RAG (F04, F07) use markdown documents and PostgreSQL embeddings, queried via FastAPI for context-aware outputs.
- **Development Timeline**: High-priority features (F01-F05, F07) targeted for MVP completion within 4-6 months, medium/low priorities within 9 months.

## Success Metrics
- **Feature Completion**: Deliver all high-priority features (F01-F05, F07) within 6 months, medium/low priorities within 9 months.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Achieve proficiency in LLM integration (F01, F04, F07), RAG (F04, F07), and image processing (F12, F14) within 6 months.
- **Portfolio Impact**: Showcase all features on thinkheads.ai, achieving 10+ employer views via X/LinkedIn within 9 months.
- **Engagement**: Attract 10+ active users to interactive features (F10, F13, F15) within 12 months.
- **Performance**: Ensure low latency (e.g., <2s for LLM responses in F01, F04, F07; <10s for avatar generation in F14).
