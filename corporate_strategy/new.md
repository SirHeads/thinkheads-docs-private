# ThinkHeads.ai Business Model

## Overview
ThinkHeads.ai isn’t a startup or a business—it’s my personal playground for mastering AI, machine learning, and deep learning. Looking to launch a new career in this amazing ride of technological advancements I’ve been following, I figured why not document my learning, struggles, and successes as a public portfolio highlighting the adventure? For fun, I’m taking my product management experience and diving headfirst into AI with this “company-like” project, building five sub-products: an AI-driven website, Learning Assistant, Meeting Room, Online Card Game, and User Profiles. The business model is to effectively showcase how I’ll make that happen and turn it into a career I’m passionate about.

## Revenue Model
ThinkHeads.ai isn’t chasing profits—it’s chasing skills and a dream job in AI. This project runs on a zero-revenue model, and my budget is as fake as my company. I’m going heavy with free/open-source tools to keep costs near zero—what an amazing gift these tools are! I’m using one local and one cloud server combo, hoping to keep costs under $100 a month all in. It’s aggressive, but it will push my learning, adaptation, and understanding of these capabilities even deeper. Additional costs beyond the two servers will be proposed as business cases and evaluated over time.

## Key Activities
I’m not a one-person army building thinkheads.ai—I’m one person building an AI-powered army on thinkheads.ai. Here’s what I’m up to:
- **Tech Stack**: Setting up Proxmox and Linode with Ollama, FastAPI, n8n, and PostgreSQL to power sub-products like the AI-driven website and Learning Assistant. Hardware selection, software stack, model evaluation, server and environment design, scripted deployments, and automated monitoring are all outlined and showcased online.
- **Learning AI/ML/DL**: Tackling online university courses, professional guides, library books, and AI-assisted guides (via Chief) to master LLMs, RAG, and image processing for projects like Meeting Room and User Profiles, at nearly zero cost.
- **Creating Solutions**: Building hands-on sub-products (e.g., Online Card Game, User Profiles’ avatar generation) to solve real problems with skills I’m learning on the fly.
- **Portfolio Showcasing**: Documenting my journey and sub-products on thinkheads.ai, sharing via social media and LinkedIn to inspire employers and friends.

## Resource Allocation
I’m building thinkheads.ai with what I’ve got, leaning on my home setup and a tiny cloud server to make big things happen:
- **Proxmox Server**: My powerhouse runs LLMs (Ollama), image processing (Imagen), and dev environments in LXC containers and VMs.
- **Linode Server**: A lean 4 GB RAM server (Debian OS) hosts the public thinkheads.ai site with Hugo and Nginx, keeping things fast and cheap.
- **Time**: After other commitments, I budget 20 hours/week for development, 20 for passive learning, and 10 for strategy, management, and promotion.
- **Tools**: Free/open-source stars like Ollama, n8n, Nginx, Proxmox, RustDesk, and FastAPI let me build big without breaking the bank.

## Partnerships
I’m flying solo, but my “partners” are my new AI friends I’m looking to establish. Truthfully, the free and open-source community, forum posters, home-labbers, YouTubers, universities, and professionals who share their work for free—they’re why I’m here today, believing I can do things I never could before. What amazes me more than the AI itself is the presence of answers for every extremely specific issue. Ultimately, it’s because a stranger helped another for nothing in return, sharing a journey and passion. I’m also grateful to anyone who’s visited thinkheads.ai—I’d love to hear your feedback. Thanks for giving it a shot!

## Success Metrics
ThinkHeads.ai is my ticket to an AI career, and here’s how I’ll know I’m on track:
- **Skill Wins**: Master employable AI dev/ops, development, and automation skills by October 2025, then tackle the machine learning and deep learning track by February 2026.
- **Portfolio Buzz**: Launch a beta release of the AI-driven website by October 2025, gather early adopter feedback, and achieve a public launch with three sub-products (AI-driven website, Learning Assistant, Meeting Room) by February 2026.
- **Resume Reconstruction**: Reframe my experience to focus on AI-related skills and projects by September 2025, ready for job applications.
- **Job Hunting**: Use AI-guided skill selection and project prioritization to submit 20+ job applications and land 3+ interviews in AI/ML by January 2026.
- **Community Fun**: Attract 10+ returning users (friends and techies) to engage with the Online Card Game or User Profiles by July 2026, spreading the joy of thinkheads.ai.
- **Smooth Operations**: Maintain 99% uptime for thinkheads.ai and automate 80% of infrastructure maintenance (backups, deployments) by October 2025.

## Operational Strategy
- **Development Workflow**: I code in VS Code with AI assistance (e.g., Ollama, custom models), manage Git repos on Proxmox, and sync to Linode for the public thinkheads.ai site. FastAPI drives dynamic features, tied to Ollama, n8n, and PostgreSQL across development, test, and production environments.
- **RAG Power-Up**: My markdown docs feed into the RAG pipeline (Ollama, PostgreSQL) for smart planning in the Meeting Room sub-product, keeping things sharp.
- **Scalability**: Hugo and Nginx keep the website light on Linode’s 4 GB RAM, while Proxmox handles heavy AI tasks. GPU scheduling and workflow automation ensure my RTX 5060 Tis don’t clash.
- **Visibility Plan**: I’ll post updates on social media, share demos on LinkedIn, and vlog about my AI journey on thinkheads.ai to draw in employers and curious techies.
