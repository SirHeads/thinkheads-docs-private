# ThinkHeads.ai Project Overview

## Purpose
ThinkHeads.ai is my adventure to master artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning through hands-on projects, showcasing my skills for our AI driven future. Seeking a career privot after time with my family, I've found myself continuously amazed by how thing are changing, and I'm going to hop on this train by building enjoyable, AI-driven tools single-handedly as my attempt to demonstrate technical mastery, creativity, and professionalism while engaging friends and the tech community. I'm having an awesome time, and I hope you enjoy!

## Background
With a background in product management across software and data products, a lockdown induced career break with my children extended longer than I expected. Just as I was ready to get on a career track again, I found myself the only option to aid my mother in caring for my father during his recovery from a sudden series of strokes. They are good, he's ready now, and so am I.  I'm gong to set my sights on AI/ML/DL, where the most exciting job opportunities lie. Lacking direct experience, and with time out of the workforce, I had to do something, so I created thinkheads.ai my fake in a funny way company-like initiative to learn cutting-edge AI skills, build a job-ready portfolio, and highlight my ability to deliver complex projects. My goals are not something I could achive 10 years ago, and maybe I'll fail, but thinkheads.ai is going to be me using AI to solve the problems I see ahead, and my product nature can't help but to try and put these solutions out there for others to enjoy. 

## Core Values
- **Innovation**: I'm doing this because of how wonderfully uncertain the future is, now is the best of times to have fun with it.
- **Self-Reliance**: Manage all development and operations alone, using automation to maximize efficiency and personalilze AI you can trust.
- **Learning**: Prioritize previously unatailable skill growth in AI/ML/DL. Hands-on-projects, free online courses, with AI assisted learning.
- **Community**: Build fun, interactive features to engauge with friends, family, and tech-enthusiest. The most important thing I'm going to learn, is how to love it, maybe I can share that too.
- **Free and Open Source**: Whenever and where-ever possible I'm going free and opensource. Paid products are great too, but these options existing, benefits us all, and may become even more important in the future. Plus, my budget is as fake as my company is.

## High-Level Goals
- **Skill Development**: Demonstrate AI/ML/DL skills (e.g., automation, RAG, Python, Statistics) through three major website releases within 6 months.
- **Portfolio Creation**: Launch five thinkheads.ai sub-products on thinkheads.ai within 6 months.
- **Employment**: Secure role in AI/ML/DL for a forward thinking organization.
- **Technical Excellence**: Get more out of what's basically a nice gaming computer than anyone ever has.
- **Community Engagement**: Attract 100+ unique visitors and 10+ active users to interactive features via direct community engaguement within 6 months.

## Target Audience
- **Myself**: Use educational and planning tools to accelerate AI learning and project management.
- **Potential Employers**: AI/ML companies seeking candidates with hands-on LLM, RAG, and full-stack experience.
- **Tech Community**: For the curious lurkers, thinkheads.ai should feel unique and worth the look.
- **Personal Network**: Friends engaging with fun features like the card game and AI-generated avatars.

## Operational Context
Powered by a local Proxmox server for AI tasks and a Linode cloud server for public hosting, thinkheads.ai ensures scalability and efficiency. (lmao, gaming pc + budget cloud) I dedicate 20 hours/week to project development, 20 hours/week to passive learning, and 10 hours/week on promoting and managing my fake company, all using automation (n8n) and AI tools (Ollama, Imagen) to somehow manage operations with no human aid. All work is documented in a various Git repositories with some shared publicly via thinkheads.ai and others available on request.

## Success Metrics
- **Learning**: Complete three AI/ML/DL projects with documented outcomes within 6 months.
- **Portfolio**: Publish live demos and markdown documentation on thinkheads.ai, achieving 10+ employer views within 6 months.
- **Employment**: Submit 20+ job applications, securing 3+ interviews in AI/ML within 6 months.
- **Engagement**: Attract 100+ unique visitors and 10+ active users to interactive features within 6 months.
