# ThinkHeads.ai Project Overview

## Purpose

ThinkHeads.ai is my adventure to master artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning by building a portfolio to showcase my skills for our AI-driven future. This platform, powered by AI tools like my chat assistant Chief, solves my learning and project challenges, and its capabilities are live for you to explore. Read on to learn more, or visit ThinkHeads.ai and let Chief guide you through my journey!

## Background

With a background in product management across software and data products, a lockdown-induced career break with my children extended longer than expected. Just as I was ready to return to work, I became the only option to help my mother care for my father during his recovery from a sudden series of strokes. They’re doing well, he’s ready, and good-god so am I. Lacking AI experience and with time out of the workforce, I created ThinkHeads.ai—a playful, company-like initiative to learn cutting-edge AI skills, build a job-ready portfolio, and deliver complex projects solo. My goals are bold, and maybe I’ll fall on my face, but ThinkHeads.ai is my way of using AI to solve my future-focused problems. I’m having an awesome time, thanks for checking it out, and I hope you enjoy!

## Core Values

- **Innovation**: I’m doing this because the future is wonderfully uncertain, and now’s the best time to have fun with it.
- **Self-Reliance**: Managing all development and operations alone, using automation and a trusted team of AI agents.
- **Learning**: Prioritizing unattainable skill growth in AI/ML/DL via hands-on projects, free online courses, and AI-assisted learning.
- **Community**: Building fun, interactive features to engage friends, family, and tech enthusiasts. The most important thing I’ll learn is how to love it, and I hope to share that too.
- **Free and Open-Source**: Wherever possible, I’m going free and open-source. Paid products are great, but these options benefit us all and may grow even more vital in the future. Plus, my budget is as fake as my company!

## High-Level Goals

- **Skill Development**: Demonstrate competence in AI/ML/DL skills (e.g., automation, RAG, Python, statistics) through three major website releases within 6 months.
- **Portfolio Creation**: Launch five ThinkHeads.ai sub-products on ThinkHeads.ai within 6 months.
- **Employment**: Secure a role as an AI/ML engineer or researcher in a forward-thinking organization.
- **Technical Excellence**: Gain full-stack exposure and experience, discover my true passion, and excel at it.
- **Community Engagement**: Attract 100+ unique visitors and 10+ active users to interactive features via direct community engagement, including social media posts, beta releases, and market research efforts within 6 months.

## Target Audience

- **Myself**: Using educational and planning tools to accelerate AI learning and project management.
- **Potential Employers**: AI/ML companies seeking candidates with hands-on LLM, RAG, and full-stack experience.
- **Tech Community**: For curious lurkers, YouTube and forum posters, thanks for all you do. I hope ThinkHeads.ai feels unique and is worth the look.
- **Personal Network**: I always want my friends and family to be well, have fun, and laugh a bit. Maybe you’ll find that here, with a few easter eggs sprinkled in.

## Operational Context

Powered by a local Proxmox server for AI tasks and a Linode cloud server for public hosting, ThinkHeads.ai punches above it's weight class on scalability and efficiency. I dedicate all the time each week I have to it; 20 for development, 20 for passive learning, 10 for strategy, management, and promotion. I manage everything solo, using automation and AI. All work is documented in various Git repositories, with public examples shared on ThinkHeads.ai and private ones available on request for potential employers.

## Success Metrics

- **Learning**: Complete three AI/ML/DL projects with documented outcomes within 6 months.
- **Portfolio**: Publish live demos and markdown documentation on ThinkHeads.ai, achieving 10+ employer views within 6 months.
- **Employment**: Submit 20+ realistic job applications, securing 3+ interviews in AI/ML within 6 months.
- **Engagement**: Attract 100+ unique visitors and 10+ active users to interactive features within 6 months.
